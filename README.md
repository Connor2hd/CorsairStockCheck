# CorsairStockCheck
A small Python script I made to check for a product on Corsairs website.  I missed out on a good sale of a USB SSD drive and thought 
this might help me catch it in the future.

### Tools and Technology Implemented
Since the corsair page that is being parsed is just HTML I used the [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
library for Python.  I also used Googles free and portable SMTP server to send out the email.
